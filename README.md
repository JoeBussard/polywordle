# Polywordle

A remake of Wordle, done in Python. Polywordle is not affiliated with the New York Times or Josh Wardle, nor is it affiliated with any other Wordle remakes. The beauty of Polywordle is that you can play an unlimited amount of words per day. If you see a word that you think was a good challenge, you can share the "share ID" of the word with a friend to compare scores.

### Installation

Clone the git repository.

### Running

To play in the terminal, run `cd polywordle/src && python application.py`

### Options

There are no command line options yet.

### Cheating/Spoilers

In version 0.1 the answer was always WHACK.
