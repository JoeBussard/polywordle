# polywordle

A remake of Wordle, done in Python. Polywordle is not affiliated with the New York Times or Josh Wardle, nor is it affiliated with any other Wordle remakes. The beauty of Polywordle is that you can play an unlimited amount of words per day. If you see a word that you think was a good challenge, you can share the "share ID" of the word with a friend to compare scores.

### Installation

`git clone https://github.com/joebussard/polywordle`

### Running

`cd polywordle/src && python application.py`

### Options

There are no command line options yet.

### Cheating/Spoilers

At the top of `application.py` you can change `CHEATING` to `True` so that you know the word at the beginning of the game. But that would be cheating.
